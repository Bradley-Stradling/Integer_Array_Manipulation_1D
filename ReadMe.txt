This is a C++ Console program written in Microsoft Visual Studios 2019.

Code contained in Source folder.

Goal:
Create A console window application that shows results of various 
1 dimensional numeric array manipulations and displays them on screen.

Each array manipulation function is labeled on the end of its name with "_1D"
to represent the algorithm is used for 1 dimensional arrays.

Function prototypes and definitions are number in comment as they appear.

Functions definitions are contained in "Integer_Array_Manipulations_Functions"

This was meant to be a simple project to grasp some basic array algorithms 
commonly used.

Input error handling for this program only reuqires a range and input failure check
as only integers are taken as an input.
